        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>Creating the navigation was not as bad as I first thought it would be. The HTML was what we learnt in class with the 5 pages needed within the website. 
        The CSS however consisted of a few things such as the background colour (thanks to coolors I ended using a palette consisting of nice colours throughout the webpages), 
        padding, grid area since we needed grid formatting and then some hover features and actually being clickable.</p>
        <h2>Main Page</h2>
        <p>The main page was a normal page which used the grid layout we were taught in class to basically introduce what the website is about, 
            which in this case was it being a portfolio about myself. The grid layout consisted of a header, navigation menu, aside, main and a footer at the end. 
            The HTML and CSS for these were kinda easy since it was colours and spacing them out evenly. With the grid layout used they had to be columned out which I 
            used percentages and they needed their own areas to be situated in. I also messed around with some animations when trying to implement some. 
            This allowed me to implement keyframes with transformation properties to move images/gifs around in the screen.</p>
        <h2>Project Page</h2>
        <p>The project page was the page which mainly had to include the projects which makes this website as a portfolio, 
        however since I have not done any individual projects yet I have used filler images that will hopefully be replaced when I start making and 
        coding my own projects in the future which I am looking forward to. It can use some spacing and a couple more pictures but I think it will look better 
        when actual projects get added within it.</p>
        <h2>Contact Page</h2>
        <p>This page consisted of an email form using the mailto service which prompts an email service when filling in the fields and pressing the button to send a message. 
        I will admit it was quite difficult using css to create the box to be in the center of the page with its contents neatly inside, 
        however apart from it being an email form it ended up being okay and not too over the top. It also allowed me to write extra comments at the bottom to add some words 
        to the page.</p>
        <h2>Video Page</h2>
        <p>The video page will only consist of the video in an iframe as it isnâ€™t really anything other than a video showcasing the code and the website.</p>
        <h2>Site report Page</h2>
        <p>This is the current page you are viewing the report from. This purely just contains text about the website development process and made to be read by you.</p>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Creating the website as a whole was an okay process. I guess if I had all the time in the world it would look much better 
        but there is only so much time I can spend with things going around in life, id like to be able to use this website as a starting 
        point in computer science learning as I have learnt a lot regarding html and css from it.</p>
